## 🤖 What is Neo LLM Core?

**neo-llm-core** is the Large Language Model gateway for NeoShade AI.  
It handles context-aware queries, moral filtering, and response generation across all major modules — from voice messages to memory vaults.

This is the brainstem.  
LLMs plug in here. Prompts get filtered here.  
And your AI legacy doesn’t just think — it reasons with intention.
